# In cases where instances take very long to spawn (10+ min in an case that I worked with)
#   you don't want to wait for every instance to finish spawning before you move to the next
#   one. One way to avoid this is to disable wait_for_instance and insert a waiting time
#   before adding a floating_ip. This works because adding a floating ip does not require
#   the instance to be fully created.
all:
  create_server:
    wait_for_instance: no
    wait_before_floating_ip: 12  #seconds
